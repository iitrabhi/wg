#### Creating a Repository Using a Template:

3. **What is a Repository?**:
    
    - A repository, often abbreviated as repo, is a storage space where your project lives. It can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets - anything your project needs.

#### Basic Git Terminology:

- **Commit**: Recording changes to the repository. Think of it as taking a snapshot of your current project state.
- **Stash Changes**: Temporarily shelving (or stashing) changes you've made to your working directory so you can work on something else.
- **Pull**: Updating your local repository to match the newest version in the remote repository.
- **Push**: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository.
- **Clone Repository**: Making a copy of a remote repository to your local machine.
- **Fetch Origin**: Fetching changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local repository.

#### Adding Collaborators:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
    - In your GitHub repository, click on `Settings`.
2. **Add Collaborators**:
    - Navigate to `Collaborators`.
    - Click on `Add People` and enter their GitHub usernames.

#### Workflow Reminder:

- Always remember to `fetch origin` and `pull` before you start working on your local repository.
- Before `pushing` your changes, ensure your local repository is up to date with the remote repository to avoid conflicts.
