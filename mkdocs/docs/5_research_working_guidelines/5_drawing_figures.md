# Creating High-Quality Figures for Research Papers Using Inkscape 
Good quality figures play a critical role in the success of research papers, often making a significant impact during the editorial review process. In this guide, we will walk through the process of drawing high-quality figures using **Inkscape**, a free and powerful SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) tool. Let's start by learning how to use it. 
## Step 1: Install Inkscape
Inkscape is a free, open-source vector graphics editor that can be used to create figures for research papers. You can download Inkscape from the official website [here](https://inkscape.org/). Once installed, you will be ready to begin creating your own figures. 
## Step 2: Learn the Pen Tool 
One of the most important tools in Inkscape for drawing figures is the **Pen Tool**. It allows you to draw custom shapes, curves, and lines that are essential for creating precise, clean figures. To master the Pen Tool, you can complete an interactive tutorial [here](https://bezier.method.ac/). 
This tutorial will help you understand how to draw curves and straight lines, providing you with a fundamental skill for creating custom diagrams. After completing this tutorial, you should be comfortable using the Pen Tool in Inkscape. 
## Step 3: Drawing Figures in Inkscape 
Now that you are familiar with the Pen Tool, you can begin drawing figures. Here are some basic steps: 
1. **Open Inkscape** on your system. Open the drawing.svg file provide below in the inkscpae.  Open the file in inkscape and then save as template. 
2. You have to open the drawing file given to you and open it in Inkscape.
