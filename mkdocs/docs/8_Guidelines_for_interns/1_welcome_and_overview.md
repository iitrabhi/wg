## Introduction to Avkalan Labs

At Avkalan Labs Private Limited, we are building technology at the intersection of physics, engineering, and computation. Our projects are bold, ambitious, and rooted in scientific curiosity. Whether we're simulating the fracture behavior of materials, designing smart biomedical devices, or rethinking the very structure of knowledge in engineering, we are united by a shared purpose: to go from practice to principle and back again—smarter every time.

We are a team of thinkers, builders, engineers, and researchers who believe that progress is made not just through hard work, but through first-principle thinking and relentless curiosity. As an intern, you’re not here to do routine tasks—you’re here to challenge yourself, solve real problems, and grow into someone capable of tackling the world's hardest engineering questions.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is for highly motivated individuals—students, early professionals, or self-taught learners—who are eager to dive deep into real-world problems, contribute to cutting-edge projects, and learn by doing. If you're someone who:
- Thrives in open-ended problem spaces,
- Enjoys learning new concepts from scratch,   
- Values impact over titles,
- Is excited by simulations, scientific computing, or advanced manufacturing,
- then you're exactly who this guide is written for.
Whether you're exploring opportunities, applying, or already selected, this guide will walk you through what it's like to be an intern at Avkalan Labs—from first contact to final project demo.
## What We Look for in an Intern
We don't care much about where you come from or what your GPA is. What matters to us is your mindset, your passion for solving hard problems, and your willingness to learn.

We look for:
- **Motivation over money:** You're not here for the stipend (though we respect your time), you're here because you're excited to learn and contribute.
- **Project ownership:** You want to treat your project as your own—not just a task, but a mission.
- **Curiosity & depth:** You're willing to dig into the fundamentals, not just skim the surface.
- **Autonomy with alignment:** You can work independently but are also open to feedback, iteration, and collaboration.

Interns at Avkalan Labs are treated as collaborators, not task-followers. We value your ideas and expect you to push us as much as we push you.

## Our Ethos: Innovation Through Curiosity
We believe that curiosity is the engine of innovation. The best breakthroughs don’t come from just following instructions—they come from asking questions that no one else thought to ask. That’s why our culture is built around exploration, experimentation, and open dialogue.

Internships at Avkalan Labs are not just about contributing to existing projects—they’re about discovering what’s possible when you challenge assumptions, break things thoughtfully, and build back better.

We encourage you to follow your instincts, explore unfamiliar fields, and connect seemingly unrelated ideas. We’re not building a factory of interns—we’re building a community of future engineers, researchers, and founders who will define the next era of scientific progress.
