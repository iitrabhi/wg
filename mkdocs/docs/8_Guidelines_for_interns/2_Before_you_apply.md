## Before You Apply
### Why Intern at Avkalan Labs?

We’re not your typical company, and this is not your typical internship.

At Avkalan Labs, internships are about exploration and ownership. You’ll be working on real problems—ones that don’t have pre-defined answers. You’ll be mentored, but not micromanaged. You’ll build things that matter. From collaborating with research organizations like ISRO to designing smart biomedical devices, our projects impact real systems and real people.

This is a place for those who want to challenge the norm, step out of comfort zones, and contribute meaningfully to technological advancement. If that excites you more than coffee runs and PowerPoint slides, you’re in the right place.

### Understanding Our Mission & Values

At Avkalan Labs, our mission is to push the boundaries of multi-physics simulations and computational engineering with precision and excellence. We empower industries and researchers by delivering cutting-edge solutions that transform complex simulation challenges into high-fidelity results. Our work is driven by accuracy, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of scientific rigor.

To achieve this, we operate based on six core values that define our approach and culture:

1. First-Principle Thinking

We break down every problem into its most fundamental components and question every assumption. Instead of relying on conventions, we build from the ground up—seeking the deepest possible understanding of the systems we work on.

2. 1% Better Every Day

We believe in the power of incremental progress. By striving to improve just 1% daily, we cultivate a culture of relentless growth and continuous innovation. Every experiment, every iteration, every lesson learned moves us forward.

1. Pride in Precision

We take precision seriously. Whether it's in simulations, modeling, or product development, attention to detail is what leads to breakthrough discoveries and high-impact solutions. Excellence is not optional—it’s a fundamental requirement.

2. Passion Leads the Way

We thrive on challenges. The problems we solve are complex, but we’re driven by the excitement of finding answers that matter. Our motivation comes from the impact our work can have—not just on technology, but on the world.

1. Continuous Learning

Learning never stops at Avkalan Labs. We are committed to an environment of ongoing education and skill enhancement, where curiosity is encouraged, and knowledge-sharing is the norm.

2. Transparency Through Teamwork

Great ideas emerge through collaboration. By openly sharing progress, challenges, and insights with our team, we foster an environment where innovation can flourish. We believe that knowledge should not be siloed but leveraged collectively.

  

Why These Values Matter

These principles are not just words on a page—they are the foundation of how we work, innovate, and grow together. If these values resonate with you, then you are in the right place.

### Types of Internships Offered

We currently offer internships in the following domains. These are not rigid departments—they’re evolving focus areas. If your interests don’t fit neatly into a box, that’s okay. We like unconventional thinkers.

- Scientific Computing & Simulation  
    (e.g., fracture mechanics, thermal physics, electromagnetic modeling)  
      
    
- Product Design & Engineering  
    (e.g., smart devices, wearable systems, additive manufacturing)  
      
    
- Software Development  
    (e.g., cloud infrastructure for simulations, custom UI for engineers)  
      
    
- Applied AI/ML  
    (e.g., pressure mapping from sensor data, signal filtering)  
      
    
- Knowledge Systems  
    (e.g., building structured learning paths for core engineering disciplines)  
      
    

We also encourage self-proposed projects, if you have a compelling idea aligned with our work.

  

### Ideal Intern Profile

There’s no perfect intern—but here are some traits that many successful Avkalan interns share:

- You’ve built something on your own—a project, a blog, a tool, a simulation.
    
- You enjoy learning for the sake of it, not just to pass exams or win contests.
    
- You’re okay being a beginner—humble enough to not know, bold enough to figure it out.
    
- You ask great questions, and you’re not afraid to be wrong.
    
- You value impact—not as a buzzword, but as a direction.
    

We don’t need you to have all the answers. But we do want to see that you care about the questions.
